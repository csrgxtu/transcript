For 74 years, the might of Soviet socialism was so great
it split the world along Eastern and Western lines.
Then, in 1991, it collapsed completely.
One by one, the various countries which had supported the Soviet Union
began splitting away,
declaring their independence.
The parliament of the Eastern Slav Republic
followed suit, declaring the country a sovereign state,
independent from Soviet rule.
Capitalism advanced rapidly.
The conglomerates gained influence in political circles,
and as a result, the oligarchs came into power.
In the Eastern Slav Republic,
the divide between rich and poor  became so great
it ignited the fuse of a new rebellion.
The push for independence
exploded into the streets.
Armed freedom fighters pitted themselves against their government,
now controlled by the oligarchs.
The military prospered during this time,
becoming ever stronger and better equipped.
Under the guidance of Ivan Judanovich,
an Ataman from the Council of Elders,
the freedom fighters moved their base
to a hidden location.
A more suitable place to launch
their guerrilla war against the government.
After several years of brutal fighting,
it was Svetlana Belikova,
Eastern Slav's first female president,
who offered a ceasefire to the freedom fighters.
But the break from hostilities was short-lived.
In November of 2010, the government discovered
that the rebels' land contained valuable resources.
The military continued their attacks,
claiming they were fighting terrorism.
Losing one base after another to the military's onslaught,
the freedom fighters escalated their efforts
and became more and more radical in their tactics.
It was then that strange rumors
began spreading like wildfire among the people
that monsters had joined the battle.
In February of 2011,
the rumors made it to the old city of Holifgrad,
just a few kilometers from the Presidential Palace,
an important strategic location for the government.
Listen to the words of the elders.
We have finally gained the power that we need.
Power that will lead us to victory.
Gather, people.
Gather and fight.
Fight for independence!
Retreat! We're getting slaughtered!
Another rebel!
Do not resist arrest.
- Retreat! - Drop your weapons.
Surrender immediately. - Government pigs!
I repeat, do not resist arrest.
Surrender immediately.
Moving into position.
COPY-
I've got a clear view of you from the sky.
Great.
Maybe you can help me find a clear route to the CIA drop-off.
Looks like they're doing some serious renovations down here.
Listen to me carefully, Leon.
Your mission has been aborted.
The U. S. is going to pull out of the country.
What? I just got here.
After taking me off furlough and sending me to this
godforsaken place?
What the hell?
Washington and the government there have decided to go their separate ways.
Everyone has to leave, not just embassy staff
All American citizens have been ordered to evacuate the country.
I don't give a damn about the politics.
We've got confirmation that B.O.W.s are being used in this war.
If we don't stop them now,
the same shit will happen everywhere.
Do you really wanna see that?
This is a war and things are different.
No one can do anything without backup from the American government.
Not even you.
Well then, I guess my only option is to
lose my American citizenship for a while.
Leon!
She can tell them I got lost and missed my flight.
Better hurry up and get this done.
I need some breakfast.
Scarecrow.
I'm the Tin Man. Can you talk?
What's the connection between the anti-government forces and the B.O.W.s?
I guess scarecrows aren't known
for rousing conversation.
Hang in there.
I'll get you out of here.
Bee--
What?
Say that again.
Bee
keeper.
Beekeeper?
The honeybee I saw outside.
Great. Now I got a cowardly lion to deal with.
It's the army.
Is anyone here?
Check the room down there.
Hey-- Unh!
Don't say a word.
How about that one? Shh.
Huh?
This one's clear.
Clear.
- This one's clear. - We're moving on.
Pull out.
They're gone.
We better stay here a while longer.
They may come back.
Do you think our hostage
will be of any use?
Do you know who we are?
Are you Dorothy?
You people in the CIA call us terrorists.
But we prefer to call ourselves
pro-independence fighters.
What is the CIA doing here?
Did you put the government up to this?
Are there any more of you?
I'm not a CIA agent.
I'm just an American who was screwed out of his vacation,
dumped on a plane and brought here.
Without breakfast.
They came for you while you were on vacation?
Hey, Buddy.
He's got to be high up in the CIA for them to do that.
You watch too many movies.
Then what are you?
Is it common for people in America
to be packing one of these while on vacation?
Sure. We've been doing it since the country was founded.
Wow, America's the bomb, yo!
Eh.
Whatever.
But even if you're not CIA,
there is no doubt you must be pretty special
for America to send you here.
You were able to take on that thing, after all.
If you don't stop messing around with that thing,
you're gonna get us all killed.
There is no doubt about the fact that you are our enemy.
An anti-terrorist sweep is now in operation.
Civilians should avoid
going outside as much as possible.
If you see any suspicious people or behavior,
report it to the authorities immediately.
Hm.
Status.
Some escaped underground.
But it's only a matter of time before they are rounded up.
Tell me in more detail.
When, exactly?
Well...
Um...
You see--
How many times are you going to make the same mistake?
We should have become a member of the United Nations five years ago.
And by now be a respected member
of the international community in our role as an EU nation.
But before that could happen,
another group came crawling out of the sewers,
screaming their declarations of separatism.
And the main cause of this
is because you allowed the terrorists to do as they please.
If we don't act soon,
we will lose our chance for true independence forever.
And we cannot allow that to happen
at any cost.
Madam President.
Your visitor has arrived.
Show her in.
Welcome to Eastern Slav, my dear.
I am President Svetlana Belikova.
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you to our guest.
This young lady is a special investigator
for the United Nations' Bio-terrorism Security Alliance.
Good day, Madam President.
Gentlemen.
I have been sent here by the BSAA.
My name is Ada Wong.
Hey, you.
My name is not, "Hey, you."
I'm JD.
Although that's not my real name.
The old man's not looking too good.
He always looks like that.
Let's hope you're right.
Anyways, what are you really doing in this country?
Hey, a different question for a change.
Ugh. What I mean is,
being in America is a lot more fun than
being here, right?
I wouldn't know.
The hamburgers, man.
The fried chicken.
Food in your country's fantastic.
I could eat it every day.
Thanks for the valuable insight.
And the Hollywood movies.
I love those things.
I have 50 DVDs.
None of them are pirated.
I thought you guys hated America.
Sure, we hate it.
But things made in America?
Now, that's different.
Whatever you do,
don't push that button.
I'm not falling for that.
No way I'll allow them to trace the call.
How are things out there?
Looks like they have the old pan of the city surrounded.
We'd better wait and see how things pan out.
Bio Organic Weapons.
Also known as
B.O.W.s.
Most developed countries and the United Nations
are against the use and manufacture of B.O.W.s.
However, they are, unfortunately,
still traded on the world's black markets.
From a quick glance at this report,
I'd say that using these weapons in a real conflict
would be extremely impractical, no?
There's no way to differentiate
between friend and foe.
It is true that total control
of most of the B.O.W.s
has been nearly impossible up until now.
But a new technology that changes that fact
has recently been developed.
Tell me more.
Recent technological advancements
can establish a master/slave relationship
between a human and the B.O.W.s.
So? What do they do, crack whips at it?
Like they do with wild animals?
Not exactly.
Organisms, designed to determine
whether a host is to be a controller or a controlee
take up residence within the host's body
and creates the perfect master/slave relationship
between a human and the B.O.W.
Similar to the relationship
a queen bee shares with her worker bees.
Yo, bro. Can I speak to you for a moment?
What about?
It's about Ataman.
It could be dangerous to move him now.
And your American friend has also taken quite an interest in him.
You don't--
You don't have to worry about me.
We can't stay here forever.
Who's in there? Open the door.
- Anyone there? - Open the door.
Open up! - Stop resisting
and come out. - Step back.
Three, two,
One!
Don't move. Hands in the air. Don't move.
Stay still. Don't shoot.
Drop your guns!
Let's go. Take them away.
Keep away
from him!
He's turned!
Downstairs.
Someone is in the basement.
Shoot. Shoot!
Quick, run!
Are you all right?
Ataman.
We have to hurry.
They'll be here soon.
You...
go on ahead.
Damn, just when things were going well.
We can win this war,
can't we?
JD.
It's-- It's time
for me to go.
But I'll be rooting for you
from heaven.
Ugh. Get up, you idiot. You think that vest you're wearing is a girl's blouse?
We have to get Ataman away from here.
Huh?
Wow. I should have guessed.
Made in America.
Wait.
Where's the American?
Dead, probably.
Give me a hand.
Leave me here.
If we go on like this,
we'll all be killed
before we can launch an attack
on the capital.
Go.
Create a new future.
This way. I heard gunshots.
They're here.
I'm going to go and check on Marco.
You head to the church and join the others.
Okay.
Shh.
Hm?
Do you really think I'm gonna fall for that?
Aah!
Kill you. Do I look like I need a pruning?
Don't kill him!
That's one request I can't grant.
Ugh!
Mr. Chenkov.
I told you
not to kill him.
He was my teacher. It was him or me.
And don't forget,
he wasn't your teacher anymore.
Ugh!
Shoot.
Shoot, JD!
Why the hell carry that gun around if you're not gonna use it?
Don't worry.
I'll use it next time.
If you ever decide to shoot those things, shoot them in the head, got it?
Wait.
This way.
Two grown men should be able to open it.
So, what is this place?
Old partisans used to hole up here
back in the day.
They sure knew how to keep the enemy out.
This thing ain't gonna budge.
Stand back.
That way.
This way.
Quick.
Oh, I knew I should have
stayed off the
junk food.
Hurry LIP

Get away!
Get him. Stay away from me!
Get him.
No.
- No. No! - Get him.
Aah!
Please, somebody help me! Help me!
What's happening?
Stay away! No!
Get away!
Help!
What happened to everybody?
Anywhere we can hide?

Yeah.
What did you do to everybody?
The Plaga you were hiding got loose.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Your precious townsfolk are being controlled by a parasite.
It attaches itself to the central nervous system via the spinal cord.
The people of the town are--?
They'll never be normal again.
There must be something we can do. Rip out the spinal cord,
but the best you could hope for is paralysis or death.
You are lying!
If you really believe that, then why did you kill the old man?
But that was--
Because you knew he would never be human again.
What he says is true.
I have some more questions for you.
Maybe this time we can get to the truth.
What are we going to do?
I have to go and get it. Go and get it?
Why?
We need somebody to take over for Ataman.
You've seen what's happening outside.
Do you want that to happen to you?
What we do today will carry the country into tomorrow.
But even so...
I'll meet up with the others tomorrow to plan
an attack on the Presidential Palace.
Get ready for that.
I'll be back soon.
I want a word with him.
He's gone to get it. The Plaga?
I don't know its name.
All I know is that it was given to us by the elders.
You inject that stuff into your body to control the Lickers, right?
Some compassionate elders you got there.
What other options do we have?
Do you realize that the whole world ignores us?
That we are in danger of extermination?
Save your breath.
We're not gonna see eye to eye on this.
Help us.
I don't want to see him change into a monster.
Irina would not be happy about this.
Irina?
We knew her since we were kids.
